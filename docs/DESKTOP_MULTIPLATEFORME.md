## Architecture

Electron starts the backend in its main process and serves the compiled Vite interface on an available loopback port. SQLite and connection settings use the OS user-data directory. First launch defaults to simulation. Discovery, read-only connection and explicit control activation are available without restarting. The renderer is sandboxed and isolated; Node integration is disabled.

## Reproducible local build

Use Node.js 22 and native compilation prerequisites for better-sqlite3:

```sh
npm ci
npm --prefix web ci
npm test
npm run desktop:package
```

Build on each target OS. Native dependencies must match Electron and the target CPU. Output is in `release/`. Windows NSIS installs per-user with shortcuts; macOS uses DMG; Linux uses AppImage and Debian packages. OS prompts and AppImage executable permissions may require extra steps. Packages are not signed/notarized.

## GitHub release pipeline

`.github/workflows/desktop.yml` builds PR candidates and uploads temporary Actions artifacts. `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs when `package.json` or the release workflow changes on main, or by manual dispatch on main. A newer release run cancels an obsolete in-flight run for the same branch. Four runners cover Windows x64, Mac Intel, Mac Apple Silicon and Linux x64. Each executes tests and builds; startup checks cover installed Windows, mounted macOS DMG and extracted Linux AppImage. Linux CI alone disables Chromium sandbox for its startup check; normal app startup keeps sandbox settings.

Only after every matrix job passes, a separate job downloads all packages, checks required filenames, generates SHA-256 checksums, creates the tag at the tested commit and uploads assets to a draft release. It publishes the release after upload succeeds. Existing releases are never overwritten. A failed run leaves no public partial release; if asset upload fails, a draft may need inspection before retrying. Increase the package versions for a subsequent release.

Physical-console validation remains separate from packaging and software checks; see [release limitations](RELEASE_1_0.md). No automatic updater or commercial signing credentials are configured.
