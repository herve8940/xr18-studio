# XR18 Studio 1.3 — Step-by-step tutorial

[Français](USER_GUIDE_FR.md) · [Console guide (every option, French)](GUIDE_CONSOLE.md) · [Downloads](https://github.com/herve8940/xr18-studio-/releases/latest) · [Home](../README.md)

XR18 Studio controls a Behringer **XR18** (also X18 and MR18) from a computer, a tablet, and each musician’s phone for their own monitor mix. This tutorial follows a real day: install, connect, soundcheck, mix, give musicians their monitors, prepare the show. The interface is in French; this guide translates the labels.

> Screenshots were taken with an emulated mixer: channel names (Chant, Guitare 1…) are examples. On your XR18 the app shows the names and colours stored in the mixer.

## 1. What you need

- An **XR18**, X18 or MR18 (original or V2).
- A **Windows**, **Mac** (Intel or Apple Silicon) or **Linux** computer.
- **A Wi-Fi router** for the band or venue. The computer, the mixer (wired is best) and the musicians’ phones must all be on that same network. The XR18’s built-in Wi-Fi is fine for the computer alone but too limited for several phones.
- For phone monitors: any recent smartphone with a camera, to scan the QR code. No app to install.

## 2. Install

Download the file for your computer from the [releases page](https://github.com/herve8940/xr18-studio-/releases/latest). Nothing else is needed: the engine and interface are included.

| Computer | File | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `XR18-Studio-Windows-1.3.0.exe` | Double-click. Installs for your account and creates a shortcut. |
| Intel Mac | `XR18-Studio-macOS-1.3.0-x64.dmg` | Open it and drag XR18 Studio to Applications. |
| Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, M3…) | `XR18-Studio-macOS-1.3.0-arm64.dmg` | Same. |
| Ubuntu / Debian | `.deb` file | Open it in the software installer. |
| Other Linux | `.AppImage` file | Allow execution in its properties, then open it. |

Packages are not signed with a commercial certificate:

- **Mac**: the first time, **right-click › Open** and confirm, or use System Settings › Privacy & Security › “Open Anyway”.
- **Windows**: if SmartScreen appears, click **More info › Run anyway**.

Never disable your system’s protections globally. A managed computer may need its administrator.

## 3. First launch, no mixer

On first launch the app runs in **simulation**: you can explore everything without touching your mixer. The orange **Simulation** badge at the top right reminds you.

![First launch in simulation](images/tuto-first-launch.png)

In simulation, nothing is sent to a mixer and meters do not move. It is ideal for learning, preparing setlists or showing the app to the band.

## 4. Connect the XR18

1. Power the mixer and plug it into the router, or join the XR18’s own Wi-Fi from the computer.
2. Open **Réglages** (Settings), at the bottom of the left menu or via the connection card at the bottom left.
3. Click **Détecter et connecter ma XR18** (Detect and connect my XR18). With one mixer, it connects immediately; with several, pick yours.
4. The connection starts **read-only**: nothing changes on the mixer. When ready, click **Activer le contrôle** (Enable control) and confirm.

![Connection page](images/tuto-connect.png)

**On a Mac**, the first attempt makes macOS ask whether XR18 Studio may find devices on the local network: click **Allow**. Without it, the mixer is unreachable.

The connection is remembered for next time. If detection fails, open **Connexion manuelle** (manual connection) and type the mixer’s IP: `192.168.1.1` on the XR18’s own Wi-Fi, otherwise the address given by your router.

**Synchronising after connecting.** The same page offers a direction:

- **Table → PC** (Mixer → PC, recommended): reads the mixer’s current settings. Nothing is sent.
- **PC → Table** (PC → Mixer): sends a copy saved on the computer. A preview shows every difference first. Phantom power is excluded by default and needs a separate confirmation.

Do not operate the mixer from another app (X-AIR Edit, tablet…) during these operations.

## 5. Finding your way: three spaces

The app has **three spaces**: in the left menu on a computer, as icons on a tablet, at the bottom on a phone.

| Space | Pages | When |
|---|---|---|
| **Jouer** (Play) | Console, Retours (monitors), Mon ingé son (coach) | Soundcheck, rehearsal, show |
| **Préparer** (Prepare) | Setlists, Répétitions (rehearsals), Scènes (scenes) | Before: repertoire, goals, saved settings |
| **Réglages** (Settings) | Connexion & système | Find the mixer, enable control, accounts |

At the top of every page:

- the mixer status: **XR18 réelle** (green), **Simulation** (orange) or **Déconnectée** (red);
- **Tout couper** (red): mutes all 16 inputs at once, for feedback or emergencies;
- **Scènes**: save or recall settings.

The connection card at the bottom left shows whether control is enabled.

| Tablet | Phone |
|---|---|
| ![Tablet](images/app-tablet.png) | ![Phone](images/tuto-app-phone.png) |

## 6. Soundcheck with “Mon ingé son”

**Jouer › Mon ingé son** (“My sound engineer”) guides bands without an engineer in six steps:

1. Plug in and connect.
2. Say who is plugged in where.
3. Play one musician at a time.
4. Listen and fix one problem.
5. Prepare monitors.
6. Keep the good setting.

![Mon ingé son](images/tuto-coach.png)

In step 4, choose the instrument and what bothers you (“the voice is muffled”, “it squeals”…), or describe it in your own words. The adviser suggests a small correction you preview, try and can undo with **Annuler le dernier réglage guidé** (undo last guided change).

The adviser receives mixer settings and levels, **not the audio**: its advice comes from your description. With feedback, lower the level at once (or **Tout couper**) before looking for the cause. The optional OpenAI dialogue is not required; the local adviser needs no subscription. See [Mon ingé son](INGE_SON.md).

## 7. Front-of-house in Simple mode

**Jouer › Console**, **Simple** switch at the top. This is the show mode: large touch-friendly strips, one per source.

![Console in Simple mode](images/tuto-simple.png)

For each source, top to bottom:

- **name and colour** (from your mixer): tap to open that source’s detailed settings;
- **level in dB** (0 dB nominal, −∞ off);
- **fader and meter**: drag to adjust; keep the meter in green/yellow, red at the top means clipping;
- **Mute** (turns red, “Coupé”) and **Solo** (headphones only, the audience hears no change).

The right-hand strip is the **main volume**.

**Setting a musician’s monitor.** At the top, choose their monitor (e.g. “Retour Gtr”) instead of **Façade** (front of house): the faders now control what that musician hears; the audience is unaffected. Levels turn cyan as a reminder.

![Simple mode on a monitor mix](images/tuto-simple-retour.png)

Unnamed inputs are hidden; **Afficher aussi les entrées sans nom** shows them.

**Gestures everywhere**:

- **drag** to adjust, hold **Shift** for fine control;
- **mouse wheel** for small steps;
- **double-click** to return to 0 dB.

Every move goes to the mixer immediately, then the stored value is read back.

## 8. Detailed settings in Expert mode

The **Expert** switch shows the whole mixer, organised like X-AIR Edit.

![Console in Expert mode](images/tuto-expert.png)

- **Tabs at the top**: Mixer, Canal, Entrée, Gate, EQ, Comp, Envois, Main, Effets, Routage, Vumètres.
- **In the middle, the selected strip** (click a name in the bank to change).
- **At the bottom, the fader bank**.
- **On the right, the mix bar**: front of house, monitors or effects on the faders, DCA, Clr Solo, mute groups, auto mix.

**? Explications** shows, next to each view, what each setting does in plain (French) language. The [console guide](GUIDE_CONSOLE.md) collects these explanations with screenshots and all 61 effects.

![EQ in Expert mode](images/tuto-expert-eq.png)

**Common tasks**:

- **Mic gain** (Entrée tab): have the musician play loud and raise **Mic Gain** until peaks reach −12 to −6 dB. Gain belongs to the physical input, so it affects every channel using it.
- **Phantom power** (condenser mics): **48V Phantom** in Entrée, always confirmed. Never on a ribbon mic.
- **Low cut** (Entrée or EQ): 80–100 Hz on vocals and guitars removes stage rumble.
- **EQ**: drag a point on the curve; the wheel changes its width. Cut what bothers you before boosting.
- **Compressor and gate**: start from a preset (Kick, Snare, Bass, Vocal…), then set the threshold by ear.

**Always protected**: phantom power, routing and effect changes require confirmation, with preview and automatic backup. Changing the input socket or linking two channels also asks first.

The **Préréglages par instrument** (instrument presets), **Bibliothèque d’effets** (effects library) and **Tous les paramètres** (all parameters) tabs remain above the Expert console.

## 9. Monitors on each musician’s phone

Each musician sets **their own monitor** from their phone, without an app, by scanning **their** QR code.

### On the computer: create the QR codes

1. Go to **Jouer › Retours**.
2. Click **Démarrer le partage** (start sharing). The first time, your system may ask to allow XR18 Studio through the firewall: allow it for private networks.
3. Type the musician’s first name, choose **their monitor** (bus 1–6) and click **Ajouter** (Add). Repeat for each musician.
4. Each musician scans their QR code with the phone camera. **Imprimer les QR** prints a sheet with every code to tape near the monitors.

![Retours page with QR codes](images/tuto-share.png)

Each card shows whether that musician’s phone is connected. If a phone is lost or a musician leaves, click **Nouveau lien** (new link): the old QR code stops working immediately. **Retirer** removes access.

### On the phone: the “Mon retour” page

| My monitor | Saved mixes |
|---|---|
| ![Phone monitor page](images/tuto-phone.png) | ![Saved mixes](images/tuto-phone-profiles.png) |

- **Volume de mon retour**: the overall monitor volume, and **Couper** to mute it at once.
- **Ce que j’entends** (what I hear): one bar per instrument; slide right to hear it louder. The thin bar below shows the level being played now. Sources not yet sent are hidden; **Tout afficher** shows them.
- **Mes réglages enregistrés** (my saved mixes): type a name (“Concert”, “Acoustic rehearsal”) and **Enregistrer**. **Rappeler** restores the mix smoothly in about a second.
- Touching does nothing on its own: only **sliding** changes a level, so playing never moves it by accident.

**What musicians cannot do**: touch the front-of-house mix, other musicians’ monitors, gain, phantom power, effects or routing. Their link only reaches their own monitor.

**Hearing safety**: from a phone, no level goes above 0 dB, and each move can only raise a level by a small step (lowering is always free). Start low, then raise what is missing, and check the transmitter or monitor amp volume too.

**Good to know**:

- The page is **read-only** until control is enabled in Réglages.
- Sharing stops when the app closes; restart it each time. QR codes stay valid while the computer keeps the same network address (same router); on another network, print them again. Reserving the computer’s address in the router keeps it fixed.
- The connection is not encrypted: use the band’s private, password-protected Wi-Fi, never a public network.
- Adding the page to the phone’s home screen (browser menu › “Add to Home Screen”) reopens it like an app.

## 10. Prepare: setlists, rehearsals, scenes

**Setlists**: add songs to the repertoire (title, artist, tempo), then **+ Setlist** to build the running order. Name it and click **Sauvegarder** (save).

![Setlists](images/tuto-setlists.png)

**Répétitions** (rehearsals): write goals for the next rehearsal and save it with its date.

**Scènes** (scenes): a snapshot of every mixer setting (channels, processing, sends, effects…).

![Scenes](images/tuto-scenes.png)

- **Sauvegarder la scène complète**: after every good soundcheck.
- **Sauvegarder pour ReaCue (sans 48 V)**: for REAPER automation, see [ReaCue](SHOW_CONTROL.md).
- X-AIR Edit `.scn` files can be imported for archiving. To recall one, load it in X-AIR Edit, connect XR18 Studio and capture a complete scene.

The mixer is backed up automatically before every recall.

## 11. Show day checklist

1. Plug in the router, the mixer (network cable) and the computer. Speakers and monitors **at minimum**.
2. Launch XR18 Studio, check the **XR18 réelle** badge, then **Réglages › Activer le contrôle**.
3. **Scènes**: recall the band’s scene (or **Table → PC** if the mixer is already set).
4. **Jouer › Retours › Démarrer le partage**. Musicians open their QR codes and check that their page shows “En direct” (live).
5. Soundcheck: one musician at a time (**Mon ingé son**, step 3), then the whole band.
6. During the show: **Simple** mode on front of house. **Tout couper** stays at the top for emergencies.
7. After the show: **Scènes › Sauvegarder la scène complète** if anything changed.

## 12. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| “XR18 déconnectée” | Check power and network cable, and that the computer is on the same network. Try manual connection with the mixer’s IP. |
| “Réseau injoignable” or `EHOSTUNREACH` (Mac) | macOS is blocking local network access: **System Settings › Privacy & Security › Local Network**, enable **XR18 Studio**, then quit and relaunch. If the mixer’s address changed, click **Détecter et connecter ma XR18**. |
| Detection finds nothing | The firewall may block XR18 Studio: allow it on private networks. Guest networks and VLANs block discovery. |
| Faders do not move the mixer | Control is off (bottom-left card says “Lecture seule”): **Réglages › Activer le contrôle**. |
| QR code opens nothing | The phone must be on the **same Wi-Fi** as the computer (not mobile data), and sharing must be started. |
| Phone shows “Lien expiré” | The link was regenerated or removed: scan the new QR code. |
| Phone shows “Reconnexion…” | The computer slept, the app closed or Wi-Fi dropped. The page reconnects by itself. |
| Musician cannot go louder | The 0 dB ceiling is reached: raise the transmitter/amp volume or lower other sources. |
| “Une opération est en cours” | A save, scene recall or sync is running on the computer: wait a few seconds. |
| Sound changes by itself | Another app (X-AIR Edit, tablet) or ReaCue is also controlling the mixer. |

To report a problem: **Réglages › Télécharger le journal de diagnostic** (download diagnostic log), then attach it with your OS, version and steps to reproduce. The log contains no API key or password.

## 13. Backups, updates and limits

- **Backups**: export important scenes and copy the app’s data folder before updating.
- **Updates**: download the new installer from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/herve8940/xr18-studio-/releases/latest), close XR18 Studio, then install. There is no automatic updater.
- **Limits**:
  - the app receives settings and levels, **not audio**;
  - solo and meter rate still need validation on a physical mixer;
  - software tests and the emulator do not replace a real soundcheck before a show;
  - hearing safety does not replace careful monitor levels.
- **Advanced multi-device access**: opening the full console from a tablet needs HTTPS server mode with accounts, see [advanced features](FONCTIONS_0_2.md). For monitors, QR codes are enough.
